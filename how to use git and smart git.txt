Q)what is git hub?
ans)git hub is like a drive use to store data like google drive.Git and git hub are two different things
                                                              or
git is used to store our data on cloud to be used it anywhere.Git is used by git hub
Q)what is git?
ans)git is  called version control system.Git is a software that is used to transfer our data from pc to cloud
advantage of git:
1)many people can work on one project
----------------------------------------------------Difference between Smart Git and Git-------------------------------------
git can be learn by command line interface(CLI)
smart is graphical user interface (GUI)
"smart git is like a wrapper on Git"
-----------------------------------------------Commands in Git---------------------------------------------------
1)git init (to initialize git)
result is in 3 colors(white(matlab theak chalega),yellow,)
2)git status (to check how many files git can run)
result in red color means git cannot run these files
3)git add .
now every file can run by git (except red color files)
2a)git status (check again staus of files)
now after running "git add . " command if a red color file appers before now these red color files changes color from red to green means now these
files can also run by git (this process is called ""stage"" . staging has two parts untrack files(red) and untrack files(green))
now wrapping files before tranferring files on cloud this process is called """COMMIT"
4)git commit -m (to wrrap files before transferring to cloud) -m(short message)

5)git remote add origin (connect local repository to cloud repository)
git remote add origin (repository path)
6)git push -u origin master (it will ask username and password)
